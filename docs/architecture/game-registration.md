# Game registration

## Game lifecycle

`draft` → `ready` → `active` → `finished`

- **ready**: team registration (team slots, teams, invitations). Board is visible; cells are not opened.
- **active**: gameplay (`POST /api/game/cells/{cellId}/open`).

Admin transitions (`POST`, admin role):

- `/api/game/lifecycle/open-registration` — draft → ready
- `/api/game/lifecycle/start` — ready → active
- `GET /api/game/lifecycle/games/{gameId}/finish-preview` — authoritative completion preview
- `POST /api/game/lifecycle/games/{gameId}/finish` — active → finished with optimistic board versioning and an immutable result snapshot

Full finalization rules, warnings, ranking and idempotency are documented in
[`game-lifecycle.md`](game-lifecycle.md).

## Database

- `games`: `ReadyAtUtc`, `MinPlayersPerTeam`, `MaxPlayersPerTeam`
- `game_team_slots`: public / reserved team slots that define the game queue
- `game_teams`: `forming` | `confirmed` | `rejected` | `disbanded`; rejected/disbanded rows remain for history; confirmed teams can carry a pending admin disband request
- `game_team_members`: equal players (no captain role), with `JoinedAtUtc` / `LeftAtUtc` membership history
- `game_team_invitations`: unified admin/player invite flow tied to a game, optional team, and target team slot

Partial unique indexes: one `draft`, one `ready`, one `active` game at a time; one occupying team (`forming`/`confirmed`) per team slot; one active membership per player/game.

## Registration API

- `GET /api/game/registration` — snapshot for the ready game
- `POST /api/game/registration/teams` — create team on a public team slot
- `POST /api/game/registration/teams/{teamId}/join` — open team only
- `POST /api/game/registration/teams/leave` — while game is ready; confirmed teams cannot be left directly
- `POST /api/game/registration/my-team/disband-request` — confirmed team member asks an admin to disband the team
- `GET /api/game/registration/teams` — compact team list for registration screens
- `GET /api/game/registration/admin` — moderator/admin workspace snapshot with available players
- `POST /api/game/registration/admin/teams` — moderator/admin creates an empty open or closed team on the first free queue position, or on an explicit team slot when needed by tooling
- `POST /api/game/registration/admin/teams/{teamId}/assign` — moderator/admin assigns a free player or moves a player between active teams
- `POST /api/game/registration/admin/teams/{teamId}/move` — moderator/admin moves a team to another queue position, swapping with the occupying team when needed
- `POST /api/game/registration/teams/{teamId}/disband` — moderator/admin disband for confirmed teams; closes memberships and pending team invitations
- `POST /api/game/registration/teams/{teamId}/confirm` / `reject` — approve or reject a team for play
- `POST /api/game/registration/invitations` — create admin invitations for reserved or curated flows

Draft setup creates six default public team slots (`GameRegistrationDefaults`). Team size is enforced from the ready-game configuration, and the current baseline is 2 players per team.

## Panel routes

- `/panel/game-application` — player entry flow plus admin roster management when the current user has game setup capability
- `/panel/team-registrations` — dedicated moderator/admin registration workspace backed by the same registration snapshot and actions

## Current UI behavior

- Players choose between an open team and a closed team with clearer intent text.
- Open team means any eligible player can join until the configured team size is reached.
- Closed team means the roster is curated by invitation or by an admin assignment.
- Pending invitations for closed teams are attached to the team DTO and rendered alongside roster members with an awaiting-confirmation marker; they do not count as active members until accepted.
- Once a team is confirmed, players see a request-to-disband action instead of direct leave; an existing request is shown as pending.
- Moderators/admins work in a team-centric management panel with available players, explicit up/down team ordering, drag-and-drop team swaps, empty-team creation, and approve/reject actions in one place.
- Moderators/admins see pending disband requests in a prominent alert and in the team row, and must confirm a destructive dialog before disbanding a confirmed team.

## Known future work

- player-to-player invitations for closed teams;
- explicit registration settings in the game setup/global settings UI;
- clearer read-only history and audit presentation after registration closes.

## Layering and contracts

- **Transport**: `backend/openapi/deadmans.v1.yaml` documents `/api/game/registration` and `/api/game/lifecycle/*`. Regenerate frontend transport artifacts with `npm --prefix frontend run generate:transport`.
- **HTTP**: thin controllers (`GameRegistrationController`, `GameLifecycleController`); registration errors map via `Api/Mapping/GameRegistrationErrorMapping.cs` with stable `code` fields in `ErrorResponse`; DTOs via `Api/Mapping/GameRegistrationMapping.cs`.
- **Application**: `GameRegistrationService` / `GameLifecycleService` own registration rules and lifecycle preconditions; ports `IGameRegistrationService`, `IGameLifecycleService`.
- **Infrastructure**: `IGameRegistrationReadStore` + `IGameRegistrationPersistence`, `IGameLifecycleReadStore` + `IGameLifecyclePersistence`; team slot seeding via `GameTeamSlotInitializer` in `Infrastructure/Persistence/`.
- **History**: admin reject marks a team as `rejected`, closes active memberships, and cancels pending team invitations. Player leave marks `LeftAtUtc`; if the last active member leaves, the team becomes `disbanded`. Confirmed teams cannot be left directly; a member can store `DisbandRequestedAtUtc` / `DisbandRequestedByUserId`, and an admin disband records `DisbandedAtUtc` / `DisbandedByUserId`, closes active memberships, and cancels pending team invitations. Rows are preserved so future player/team/game history can be built from the same tables.
- **Frontend**: transport in `frontend/src/features/game-registration/api/`; UI in `game-application/` and `team-registrations/`. The admin panel is reused across both admin entry points. A missing ready-game snapshot (`404`) renders a normal unavailable state without disabled mock controls.
